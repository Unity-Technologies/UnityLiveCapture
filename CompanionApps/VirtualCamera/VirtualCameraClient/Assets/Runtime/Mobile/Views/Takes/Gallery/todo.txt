! MAKE SURE TO CREATE JIRA TICKETS FOR SUBSEQUENT TASKS BEFORE DELETING THIS FILE !

- (done) base-gallery-controller -> cache take collection locally for cleanup of receivers
- Test: delete Takes on server, reimport, expect client to reload the take library
- interfaces on views when useful
- (done) roundedrect should be affected by canvasgroup alpha
- activation seems to affect thumbnail star toggle view update
- use ITakeIterationView for injection etc
- (done) sort take related files (view, ctrl, ....)
- separate folder for shared files? With subfolders?
- same take-lib and live-mode buttons on both platforms
- optional: shared install code, kickstart refactoring of the installers and tackle their growth
- Container.BindInterfacesAndSelfTo<TakeLibraryModel>().AsSingle(); -> just interface
- optional: scrollview behavior improvements: jumps, margins when no scroll is needed
- should ShowTakesViewSignal be handled by the controller? use mobile specific commands
- cleaner way to handle fullscreen variants? (better than optional button?)
- (done) sometimes views subscribe in awake others in onEnable, be consistent (at least in takes stuff)
- (done) rename TakeSelectionController
- (done) initial hide of gallery doesnt belong in controller
- (done) take selection view requires variants due to differing menu...
- (done) take-iteration toggle state on mobile
- (done) rnd-rect buttons tint mess up
- (done) dont bundle take views in one prefab on mobile
- (done) move take views out of main view on tablet
- tablet, what if we exit take iteration and selection is open?

TAKE ITERATION
==============
- Take name form maps to slate properties -> do later
- use NextTakeNameReceived to update name form
- (done) clear-iteration-base
- (done) set-iteration-base (vcam-device will send slate descriptor)

WIP
===
- (done) add DateTime to take and its descriptor (creation time)
- (done) collect vcam-metadata based on slate directory
- (done) add vcam-meta descriptor and array, map to take through guid
- (done) send vcam-meta array to client
- (done) fix tests broken by take creation time
- check new take fields ok in inspectors (propertydrawers?)

Primary
=======
- (done) add take metadata
- (done) Iphone take-gallery-view variant
- (done) plug shot name in HUD
- deviceModeToggled/deviceModeClicked inconsistency in main vcam views, ShowTakesView should be promoted as well to the shared main view
- Plug take rating (star badge?)
- vcam-metadata per take policy (rn we default to last available entry).

Secondary
=========
- (done) remove initial testing code
- (done) remove initial controller, rename actual one, move to proper folder
- (done) add sensor size preset name to metadata
- check events naming
- use fat arrow syntax for one liner methods
- prefab for top-right done-button

Done
====
- (done - "starred" terminology) "focus" and "selected" in the gallery view is confusing
- (done - stick to int for the time being) SlateSelectedTakeReceived uses an int why not guid? The index corresponds to the array of TakeDescriptor received?
- (done - yes) Whenever we edit or delete a take, we'll receive the updated list of takes (OnSlateTakesReceived)?
- (done) send device mode to server
- (done) main view receives device mode
- (done) cache mainViewOptions based on DeviceMode
- (done) add take view to layout
- (done) exit takes view on exit playback
- (done) at most one thumbnail with options opened, close on bg click
- (done) close thumbnail menu when another is selected
- (done - yes for now) phone -> do we keep while-recording lens-settings btn
- (done - keep it deactivated for now) phone -> what do we do with the snapshot button?

Subsequent Tasks (Separate PRs)
===============================
- rename take scriptableobject (consistent with take data)
- don't rely on editor preview for take thumbnail
- delete screenshot/anim alongside the take SO on take deletion
- reuse RoundedRectButton whenever possible
- make a generic component to slide a rectransform according to the touchkeyboard area
- general, often our Button could have [None] transition
- split installer into feature-specific function most of which will be shared (also easier to parse)
