# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.0] - 2023-07-18

### Changed
- Restructured the whole documentation to improve navigation between the main concepts and setup tasks.
- Added conceptual information about data capture process and the required chain of elements to set up.
- Consolidated the Connection setup section and added a Capture Device and Actor setup section.
- Completed the Take recording section with base information about Shot management in Timeline and Shot Library. 
- Reformatted the Get Started sections about Virtual Camera and Face Capture companion apps as functional tutorials.

### Fixed

- Add an argument to LiveStreamCaptureDeviceEditor.DrawDefaultLiveStreamInspector to fix the feature that checks the required components for the camera tracking.
- LiveStream.Properties now uses a Dictionary instead of an IEnumerable to avoid type casting and boxing issues.

## [4.0.0-pre.5] - 2023-05-10

### Added
- Static method TimedDataBuffer.Create<T>(...) to create instances of ITimedDataBuffer<T>.
- LiveStream, a class that manages a collection of properties that can be recorded into a clip while animating the actor in the scene.
- LiveStreamCaptureDevice, a capture device that manages a LiveStream.
- LiveStreamPostProcessors, a base component that post-processes the stream managed by a LiveStreamCaptureDevice.
- CameraTrackingDevice, a base capture device for implementing camera trackers.
- SharedVolumeProfile, a component that manages an instance of VolumeProfile shared across multiple other components.
- DepthOfField, a component that manages the depth of field effect.
- LensDistortionBrownConrady, a component that manages the lens distortion effect based on the Brown-Conrady distortion model.
