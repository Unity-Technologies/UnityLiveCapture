# Capture Device and Actor setup

Use [Capture Devices](data-capture-process.md#capture-device) in the Unity Editor to:
* Map connected [Client Devices](data-capture-process.md#client-device) with [Actors](data-capture-process.md#actor) to drive in the Scene.
* Control data streaming between specific Client Device/Actor pairs according to the data you need to record.
