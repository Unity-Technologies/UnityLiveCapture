# Tips and Recommendations

## Tracking tips

Tracking works best when the relative position of the head and device is fixed, as in the following scenarios:

* (Preferred) The device is mounted to the performer's head via a helmet.
* The device is mounted to a static surface and the performer does not move their head or look around.

In both cases the **Head Position** and **Head Rotation** channels on the **ARKit Face Device** should be disabled.
