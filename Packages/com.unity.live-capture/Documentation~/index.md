# Live Capture package

>[!NOTE]
>To use the Live Capture package, you must install it separately from the Unity Editor. For detailed information about package requirements and installation instructions, refer to [Installation](installation.md).

Use the Live Capture package to:
* Capture data from physical devices to animate characters and cameras in real time within the Unity Editor.
* Record and organize multiple takes of the captured animations and iterate on them to fine-tune the recording of specific properties.
* Genlock and synchronize all connected devices to get frame and timecode accuracy across the captured dataset.
