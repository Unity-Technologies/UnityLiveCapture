# Iterative recording

Iterative recording consists in recording layered takes over several iterations. Each iteration is a duplicate of the take set as iteration base, where Animation Track overrides are added to the base tracks.

For example, when using the Virtual Camera, you may want to capture just the position and rotation of the camera, and do focus pulling in a separate take to tune the Depth of Field.

## Set a Take as the Iteration Base

* Select a take from the **Takes** list in the **Take Recorder** and click on the button with the record icon.

## Clear the iteration base

* Click the **Clear** button next to the **Iteration Base** field.

## Multi-pass recording

Multi-pass recording allows you to select a different parameter or data **Channel** to record.

1. Select the **Virtual Camera Device** component.
2. Deselect the **Channels** that should not be captured in the next recording.
3. Press the **Start Recording** button and redo the active Channels.
