# Manage Shots in a Shot Library

Use a [Shot Library](ref-asset-shot-library.md) to prepare and manage your shots when you don't necessarily have a Timeline for cinematic context.

## Create a functional Shot Library

1. In the Hierarchy, right click and select **Live Capture** > **Shot Player**.

2. Select the new GameObject named Shot Player.

3. In the Inspector, in the **Shot Player** component, beside the **Shot Library** field, click on **Create**.

4. Name and Save the new Shot Library asset.

5. In the Inspector, use the **Shots** list to create and manage Shots in the created Shot Library which is selected in the Shot Player.

## Record and manage Takes in a Shot

Use the [Take Recorder window](ref-window-take-recorder.md#shot-browser) to manage Shot properties, record a Take in the context of a Shot, or select any existing Take to use for a Shot.
