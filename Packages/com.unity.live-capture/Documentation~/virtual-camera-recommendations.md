# Tips and Recommendations

## Tracking tips

* AR camera tracking involves image analysis, which requires a clear image. Patterned surfaces are best.

* Tracking quality is reduced when the camera canâ€™t see details, such as when the camera is pointed at a blank wall or the scene is too dark.

* Walk around the environment a bit before trying to record a performance.

## Optimal editor layout

There is a performance cost for every editor window that is visible. To prevent hitching, use a [custom editor layout](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomizingYourWorkspace.html) when capturing data from the device. The layout should only have a **Game View** and a **Connections** window visible.
