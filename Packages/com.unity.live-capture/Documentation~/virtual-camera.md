# Unity Virtual Camera

Use the Unity Virtual Camera mobile app alongside the Unity Editor to drive a Unity camera from your iPad or iPhone and record camera movement, rotation, focus, zoom, and more to achieve a handheld look-and-feel.

> **Important:** The Unity Virtual Camera app is a companion app, which means it requires the Unity Editor to function, as opposed to a standalone app.
