# Live Capture

Use the Live Capture package to:
* Capture data from physical devices to animate characters and cameras in real time within the Unity Editor.
* Record and organize multiple takes of the captured animations and iterate on them to fine-tune the recording of specific properties.
* Genlock and synchronize all connected devices to get frame and timecode accuracy across the captured dataset.

See the [package documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.live-capture@4.0/manual/index.html) for more details.
