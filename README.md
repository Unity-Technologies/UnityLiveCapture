# Live Capture in Unity Editor

With the Unity Live Capture package (`com.unity.live-capture`), you can capture animations from multiple physical devices and record them in the Unity Editor to animate characters and cameras.

The Unity Live Capture ecosystem includes companion apps ([Virtual Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unity-virtual-camera/id1478175507) and [Face Capture](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unity-face-capture/id1544159771)) that you can install for free on your iOS device to capture animations from your deviceâ€™s camera and sensors.

This repository contains  all in-development packages applications, tests, and demo projects to enable Live Capture in Unity Editor.
